# initialxy-points

A simple web app that helps track points earned by kids and allows them to redeem points for rewards.

This project was created as a personal Raspberry Pi project to help manage my children's point-based reward system. I wanted to experiment with fully local vibe coding using my Radeon RX 7900 XTX, so I generated as much of the code as possible with local LLMs models while still reviewing every line of code to ensure it meets my expectations.

**Important Security Notice**: This application is designed for use in a home network environment only. It is not intended for public access or production use and is not secure. Do not deploy this application publicly.

## Project Overview

initialxy-points is designed to help parents track their children's points that they earn through tasks and activities. It features a simple, intuitive interface for both parents and kids to manage rewards and point tracking.

## Features

- Passcode authentication for parents and children
- Task and reward management
- Points tracking
- Admin console for database management

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

First, run the admin console to initialize your database:

```bash
npm run admin
```

This will launch an admin console for managing users. Enter a SQLite database file path to get started (e.g., `database.sqlite`). Run `init-db` to create database tables.

During development, you can create a `.env` file with the following variables:

* `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD` - A secret password for session encryption. When you run the development server for the first time, one will be generated for you.
* `DB_PATH` - Path to the SQLite database file that you just created and initialized (e.g., `database.sqlite`).

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Admin Console Commands

The admin console provides these commands:

- `help` - Show this help message
- `init-db` - Initialize database
- `list` - Show all users and their roles
- `add-user <username> <password> [role]` - Add a new user
- `delete-user <username>` - Delete a user
- `rename-user <oldUsername> <newUsername>` - Rename a user
- `change-user-role <username> <role>` - Change a user's role
- `set-password <username> <password>` - Set a new password for a user
- `show-logs <n>` - Show top n log entries
- `exit` - Exit the admin console

## Deployment

[Follow Nuxt Deployment process](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/deployment). Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Make sure you set `NUXT_SESSION_PASSWORD` and `DB_PATH` environment variables before running the node server. You can generate a new session password with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Start the node server:

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

## AI Tools
As mentioned above, the objective of this project was to experiment with using *local* LLMs for coding. While the original goal was to generate nearly 100% of the code, it quickly became apparent that this wasn't feasible. Overall, I'd estimate that around 60% of the code was generated by LLMs, though I have manually reviewed every line to ensure it meets my expectations. Here are the tools I used:
* [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code) - with code indexing
* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) - for serving models
* [ollama](https://ollama.com/) - for serving embedding models separately in CPU mode
* [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) - vector database for indexing with Roo Code
* [Devstral](https://mistral.ai/news/devstral) (used during early development)
* [Qwen3-Coder](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder) (current model)

Here is the script I use to launch these tools:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/initialxy/ML/llm/llama.cpp/build/bin

session_name="llamacppstart"
